# Android scaffold

This is a minimal Android app scaffold (Kotlin + XML views).

Open `android/` in Android Studio to import the project.

Next steps (planned):
- Auth screens (register/login)
- Camera capture + upload
- Review extracted fields before saving
- Receipt list + edit

API base URL:
- Edit `android/app/build.gradle.kts` `API_BASE_URL` to match your backend host.
